# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

This project is to write a daily planner. The current date is displayed at the top using dayjs. The hour blocks are color coded as to whether itâ€™s the past future or current hour. Finally the comments are able to be saved to local storage so they remain on the page even if the user leaves the session.
